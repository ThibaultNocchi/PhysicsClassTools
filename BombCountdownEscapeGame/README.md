# Bomb Countdown - Escape Game

This tool is used in a physic class where students need to answer different questions to find pieces of a solution, in order to put them together and defuse their bomb.  

## Summary

The teacher first chose the number of groups which will play, the time available before the bomb goes off and the password to defuse it. Capitalization isn't taken into account, so if the teacher puts in "password", students can defuse it with "PaSSwOrD".  
A new screen appears with the countdown, and inputs for different groups. When a group succeeds by finding the password, their little bomb is replaced with a green thumbs-up. For those who won't find the password, in the end, their bomb turns into a red fire.
